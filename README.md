# Token LaunchPad

This app allows users to launch custom tokens(Token 2022) on Solana with metadata. This app provides a straighforward and intuitive way for users to interact with Solana without the burden of writing scripts or using the CLI

## Stack used
- React
- Javascript
- Solana libraries

## Quickstart

### Later 

- Figure out if we can bundle all the 3 transactions together so user only has to sign once(especially since `tx1` requires a partial sign and others dont)
